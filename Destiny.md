Hedonism vs fulfillment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXvD_9r2BWY

Hedonism is when doing things that are low in friction that typically only serve your interests; they make you feel good. Like playing video games.

Fulfillment is when doing things that are paying tribute, honor to something uniquely human; something more than us. A greater purpose. Something that gives back to society, so other people can enjoy them. High-friction. Requires lots of preparation. Like gym or eating healthy.

# Black Cleopatra Controversy Leaves Destiny Speechless...


*Democracy in concept, is the **expressed will of the people in that country**. Politicians are not to do "good" or "logical" things, they're supposed to enact the **will of the people**. You have to follow the will of the people or you lose being elected.*

Opinion on race swapping. *It depends on what you're trying to show. A documentary with claims of high accuracy will make it more important, whereas for entertainment will not.*

*People hedge their current self-worth with the past. And they cannot change their minds even if they're wrong because they're emotionally attached to their narrative.*

# Politics on Twitch has become insane...


Social incentives dictate beliefs. *Little-to-no social reward in having principled conviction unless you want to be ousted from your social group. Instead, what the social group believes is what you should also believe.*

Name of the disease and the virus/bacteria are differentiated. Like SARS-COV-2 is the name of the virus, and Covid is the name of the disease. **A vaccine fights SARS-COV-2 (name of the virus)**, which prevents the chances of getting Covid (name of the disease).
