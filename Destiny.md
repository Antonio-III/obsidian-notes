Hedonism vs fulfillment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXvD_9r2BWY

Hedonism is when doing things that are low in friction that typically only serve your interests; they make you feel good. Like playing video games.

Fulfillment is when doing things that are paying tribute, honor to something uniquely human; something more than us. A greater purpose. Something that gives back to society, so other people can enjoy them. High-friction. Requires lots of preparation. Like gym or eating healthy.

# Black Cleopatra Controversy Leaves Destiny Speechless...


*Democracy in concept, is the **expressed will of the people in that country**. Politicians are not to do "good" or "logical" things, they're supposed to enact the **will of the people**. You have to follow the will of the people or you lose being elected.*

Opinion on race swapping. *It depends on what you're trying to show. A documentary with claims of high accuracy will make it more important, whereas for entertainment will not.*
https://youtu.be/9v7UcBRqYrg?t=2901

*People hedge their current self-worth with the past. And they cannot change their minds even if they're wrong because they're emotionally attached to their narrative.*

Social incentives dictate beliefs. *Little-to-no social reward in having principled conviction unless you want to be ousted from your social group. Instead, what the social group believes is what you should also believe.*

Name of the disease and the virus/bacteria are differentiated. Like SARS-COV-2 is the name of the virus, and Covid is the name of the disease. **A vaccine fights SARS-COV-2 (name of the virus)**, which prevents the chances of getting Covid (name of the disease).

# Liberals Vs Everyone Else

## [Social incentives dictate beliefs](https://youtu.be/irz0oAAlW0c?t=94)
Things that are hard to test are easier to adopt false beliefs from e.g. how institutions work, how democracy works, etc.. 

**Examples**: (1) Having a religious family might prevent a person from abandoning the Christian belief as it can damage a person's social and financial support, so the person is incentivised to stay in that Christian belief. (2) A public figure might have an audience that demands adhere to what the audience believes, and abandoning it causes financial loss, so the person adheres to what the audience believes. (3) A person in school might be pressured to believe to certain sociopolitical beliefs and abandoning it causes the person to be outcasted in a social group, so the person believes certain beliefs to fit in the social group. 


## [Constellation of Beliefs](https://youtu.be/irz0oAAlW0c?t=404)

People inherit beliefs from their social group they're in often due to social pressure that pushes to them to this belief system. The beliefs themselves have weak logic but are believed in an applied level. The beliefs are often abstract, i.e. hard to test, and so aren't easy to counter them. 

It can be hard to break someone out of the constellations of beliefs because there's always something that can explain everything (a larger-than-life concept) in the constellation is true, albeit logically false.

**Example**: (1) Anti-establishment constellation; you support Donald Trump; Oppose "woke" things; Don't trust mainstream media; Don't trust vaccines; Don't trust intelligence/health institutions. 

**Evidence**: (1) People that are part of the same constellation of beliefs will agree on everything. (2) Possessing one belief in the constellation will posses many of the beliefs in that constellation. (3) Many of the beliefs, when investigated, often contradict each other. (4) If someone thinks you're in a constellation of belief, they will project their own adherence of constellations of beliefs onto you. For example: if you say you believe *this*, someone will say you believe in: *this, this, this, and this*. This is called **webbing**, and it is a fallacy when you **webbing**. 


## [Normative Confusion with Applied Positions](https://youtu.be/irz0oAAlW0c?t=784)


Example:
Premise 1: Civilians should not be targeted in war.
Premise 2: A charge of genocide would stop Israel from killing civilians.
Conclusion: We should charge Israel with genocide.


People with Normative Confusion with Applied Positions will say that if you disagree with the soundness of Premise 2 i.e. you don't think Premise 2 is True, you necessarily disagree with Premise 1 as well. And they will ascribe to you that you think civilians should be targeted in war.

The Premises and Conclusions themselves are more-than-likely inherited from the [[#[Constellation of beliefs](https //youtu.be/irz0oAAlW0c?t=404)|Constellation of Beliefs]].

## [Humans are not truth-seeking machines](https://youtu.be/irz0oAAlW0c?t=1124)

Truth is a tool to further someone's happiness, when Truth is no longer serving that purpose, it will be abandoned in favor of another Tool, like a belief from the [[#[Constellation of beliefs](https //youtu.be/irz0oAAlW0c?t=404)|Constellation]].

In hard-science domains e.g. Science, Engineering, and Medicine, this idea does not apply since for any of the field's findings to prove beneficial, it has to adhere to reality.

Example of abandoning truth in favor of a Constellation belief is Vaccine Skepticism, and Holocaust Denialism.


## [Skeptics are rarely skeptics](https://youtu.be/irz0oAAlW0c?t=1256)

Someone who claims to be a skeptic of a social/political issue will often commit these things:

They selectively apply their skepticism across a media entity. E.g. if a media channel reports on something they agree with, they will not be skeptical of that story whereas if it reports on something they disagree with, they will be skeptical. There's nothing wrong with agreeing/disagreeing with how a story is reported, but there creates an unhealthy skepticism when skepticism only occurs when something doesn't align with your personal beliefs.

They will not move to a position that requires a critical re-evaluation of their beliefs. Instead, they will move "double-down" on their beliefs and reject any evidence that don't re-affirm their belief. An example is when you show a Vaccine Skeptic that mRNA vaccines perform well, they would rather be skeptical of the evidence than to be convinced of the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine.
