The Passenger - A movie about a scrawny quiet dude led along by his co-worker who wants to "fix" him by confronting loose ends of his (scrawny dude's) past. scrawny dude was quiet, timid, gets told what to do, and he just doesn't act on his own. co-worker guy was the opposite. radicalized, confident, confrontational, claims to be in charge. 

On the way to tying up the scrawny guy's loose ends, the co-worker was also revealed to have some trauma from the past, and that he wasn't very different from the scrawny dude. 

Movie ends with the co-worker saying that he was never in charge. In fact, he was always led by his emotions—he gets violent and resorts to threatening to kill someone should the scrawny dude leave him. After this, he gets shot by the cops.

He was always on time, organized, and could do the work his colleagues can't. 

In the end, it was shown what was it like to witness him in the perspective of his colleagues—that he was just zoned out facing a wall.— And that no one can reach him there (the room).

Tokyo Revengers (2021-ongoing) - A show about an MC having an ability to time travel by shaking hands with police guy. He uses this power to save some girl. He tries to accomplish this by rising through the ranks of the gang that killed the girl. 

Pacing is slow, so there's a few rinse-and-repeat events happening: 

(1) MC goes into the past to "save everyone" -> accomplish that goal -> back to present -> realizes it's not enough to save the girl -> cries -> meets police guy -> add a new goal to accomplish -> (1). 

(2) MC sees a new character -> doubts if they were the same person in the past/present. -> (2).

(3) In any scenario, MC says he hasn't changed anything, but the future did.

(4) MC is a moron. He forgets key details that were just mentioned in the last episode.

Also, 1 of his friends die in the present after going back to the present, cumulatively.

S1: His friend dies (He accomplished his latest goal and went into the present).
7/10

S2: Nerd guy (Arch-nemesis of MC) is a time traveler, too?
8/10

S3: Nerd guy wasn't a time traveler. He just wanted to be like MC. Absolute cinema.
