"*The computer has played the central role in that transformation, both accommodating and encouraging ever broader views of 'information' and of how it can be transformed and communicated over time and space.*"

Computers had an important role in the transformation in terms of facilitating more macro views of 'information' and how it can be changed and understood over time and space.


"*Since the 1950s the computer has replaced traditional methods of accounting and record-keeping by a new industry of data processing. As a primary vehicle of communication over both space and time, it has come to form the core of modern information technology.*" 

Computers began replacing our traditional way of accounting and record-keeping in 1950s. Compuers, being the primary communication method over space and time, eventually formed the foundation of what we would call 'information technology'.


# Data Visualization

  

## Critical Summary

  

### Context

  

The main idea I had for finding a topic to create data visualizations for is to find something that may be related to what the module is. Data visualization has some implications for using technology. What we refer to when we say: "technology", usually has something to do with computers or advanced machinery. Computers, who makes them? And how do they process data?

  

This was the line of thought I had before finalizing my topic: "Computer Languages and Tech Companies".  Computer languages are the medium for how a computer should perform a task, written usually by a person. And the computer executes the instructions with the physical parts it has.

  

There are five data sets:

1 - Average salary of Data Science jobs

2 - Popularity of programming languages

3 - Apple, Google, and Meta's stock prices

4 - Company layoffs

5 - Company stats

  
  

### Decisions

  

I wanted the data presented to be meaningful and digestible to the average viewer. I wanted to create the effect of "Oh, this data shows this. That's kind of cool." This means some of the data sets may have been filtered so the data doesn't show too many variables.

  

I've also added images where available so users can visualize the data without looking at every single label. This is just for convenience.

  

#### First data set

  

The original data set has been modified to calculate the average salary for `x` job, in `y` experience, in `z` year. This is because the original data set had multiple entries of jobs, in the same year, in the same experience.

  

This makes the data hard to grasp as there are too many variables and that there is no macro perspective; it's just a data set of jobs and their salaries in their respective positions, and years.

  

What I've done is transform the data from: "List of Data Science jobs and their salaries from 2020~2022", to: "Average Salaries of Data Science jobs from 2020~2022". This means the data presented will show information about which jobs are the highest and lowest paid in that year.

  

The original data set had more information than what's in the data set as it's presented. I've removed some of them as I thought they were irrelevant to the scope I've decided to present the data.

  

The one limitation about this visualization is that there is no way to see a discrete number of the salary. But, the size of the shape, however it is presented, is based off the the average salary listed. So there may not be a number attached to the job, but you can make a comparison for which job, on average, earns more.

  
  

#### Second data set

  

It is a: "Popular computer languages from 2004~2013" data set. A bar chart race seemed to make the most sense when visualizing this data, so I chose that.

  

Initially, the data as I downloaded was unusable because the data was sorted by columns, whereas Flourish typically interprets the data by rows. This made me create a Python script to convert the file's content to be in line with Flourish's way of interpreting data.

  

#### Third data set

  

I've used a line chart race to visualize the changing in stock prices of the listed companies. This is because I think a line chart would be a good idea to present the stock prices over time.

  

One thing to note is that the listed stock prices are from the "highest" price that stock was on that particular day, rather than what the price was on opening, or closing, or whatever else.

  
  

#### Fourth data set

  

The fourth data set is about lay-offs from tech companies. How I sorted this data is by including only companies who laid-off more than 4000 employees. This is because the original data had a lot of entries, whereas I want to keep the visualization simple to understand.

  

The filtered data set contained multiple entries from the same companies. This led to me only keeping the highest laid off count from that company. The resulting data set is what is present on the Flourish data set.

  

And, I thought a column chart would be the best way to look at the data, where you can see the before-and-after effect of the lay-offs.

  
  

#### Fifth data set

  

This data set covers 50 US tech companies and some information about them, like their market cap in trillions, the year founded, revenue, and so on.

  

I thought a bubble chart would best display the data, since the size is based off of the market cap, and it allowed for use of images, so users can easily recognize which bubble belongs to what company.

  

One thing I don't like is that most of the images in the bubbles are cut off. I hope Flourish can adjust their image-importing software to resize the image so it fits the bubbles without cutting off.

  
  

### Reflection

#### Success

  

I think I did well finding data sets in my chosen topic of: "Computer Languages and Tech Companies". The visualized data sets have been sorted appropriately and are framed such that users will have a takeaway from seeing the data sets.

  
  

I also think I've sufficiently leveraged data sets where images are allowed so users can better recognize the label being presented.

  

And how I've framed data sets to have a certain narrative to them, like the first data set, is a pretty creative way to transform a given data set.

  

Creating this project also definitely helped me understand data structures and algorithms because I wanted to sort the data using a script instead of manually by hand.

  

#### Limitations

  

I think the choice of topic for this visualization is heavily impaired by the fact that it has to be tech or software-related. There are only so many data sets that are able to give you meaningful visualizations before it's just another thousand-line-long listings of job offerings or all programming languages packed in a '.csv' file. In the case of these data sets, I can't think of a way to frame them creatively given the time constraints I have for this project.

  

Time has and will always be a problem for someone like me on any school project. Starting and finishing this project with less than a week before the deadline will always lead to a rushed output. There are data sets that I could've transformed into a more fun way of interpretation had I had more time, but this is less about the limitations of the project but more of myself.

  

Another thing was the use of images. They are sourced directly from the internet and are not processed by me, which leads to inconsistent sizing, leading to most of the images being cut off. This is also another problem that I could've fixed as well.

  

#### Recommendations

  

I think in general just starting these projects really early on with a lot of preparation will always lead to a better output. Any limitations encountered here could've been fixed by myself, but sadly the only thing I fixed was how the data is sorted, which took some amount of time creating.

  

I think learning more about Flourish to benefit from its full features would have definitely helped in presenting the project in a more professional manner.


# Debate

**1600-word** document

## Affirmative Arguments

### Most people say social media benefitted politics in their country, with exceptions.

A Pew Research survey in 2022 was conducted across **19 advanced countries** in America, Europe, Middle East, and Asia-Pacific regions. These include but are not limited to: the US, Canada, the UK,  Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Hungary, Greece, Israel, Australia, Japan, and South Korea.

Figure 1:
![[Social Media in Democracy.png]]

Across the 19 countries surveyed, a **median of 57% percent say social media has been good** for politics in their country, and a **median of 35% say it has not**.

#### Has social media been good or bad for democracy?

Figure 2:
![[Social Media has been a ___.png]]

Among the 19 countries surveyed, the US stands out, with 34% who say social media has been good, and 64% say it's been bad.

**Highest** percentage who say it’s been a **bad thing**:
	1. US - 64%
	2. Netherlands - 54%
	3. France - 51%

**Lowest** percentage who say it’s been a **bad thing**:
	1. Poland - 15%
	2. Singapore - 21%
	3. Hungary - 22%


**Highest** percentage who say it’s been a **good thing**:
	1. Singapore - 76%
	2. Malaysia - 71%
	3. Poland - 67%

**Lowest** percentage who say it’s been a **good thing**:
	1. US - 34%
	2. France - 43%
	3. Netherlands - 44%


Do note that showing a favor for one side doesn't necessarily mean a heavy leaning on the other. While Poland has the least percentage who say social media has been bad for politics in their country, it is the third-highest who say it’s been a good thing. Malaysia on the other hand is the sixth-least to say that social media has been bad, and is second-highest to say it has been good. But the countries that heavily say social media has been bad for politics in their country are also the least to say it has been good.

The authors note that having **perceived influence in politics makes one more likely to say that social media has been good for politics**. They stated that 62% of Belgians that say they have an influence in politics also think that social media has been good for politics in their country, contrast to 44% who agree and say they have little-to-no influence on politics.


#### More active social media users see social media as good
![[Active Posters See Social Media as Good.png]]

In all countries surveyed, those who post about political issues on social media say that democracy has been good in their countries. The biggest gap is in Israel where 72% who rarely or never post agree, whereas 93% who do post sometimes or often say the same. The smallest gap is in Japan where 64% of rarely-or-never-post users agree and 71% who do post say the same.

#### Potential positives
##### Social Media informs citizens about current events

![[Social Media Informs Citizens.png]]

The first two possible good outcomes is whether social media has made people **more informed about events domestically and internationally**, and the **median amount who agree is 73% in both questions**. Those who agree domestically are highly-correlated to agree internationally.

**Highest** percentage who say it has made people **more** informed:
	1. Sweden - 85%
	2. Greece, Netherlands - 82%

**Lowest** percentage who say it has made people **more** informed:
	1. Malaysia - 56%
	2. US - 64%
	3. Belgium - 68%

  
**Highest** percentage who say it has made people **less** informed:
	1. Malaysia - 27%
	2. US - 20%
	3. Singapore, Italy, Belgium - 12%

**Lowest** percentage who say it has made people **less** informed:
	1. Sweden - 1%
	2. Japan - 3%
	3. UK - 4%
  

**Highest** percentage who say it has **hasn’t had much impact**:
	1. Malaysia - 18%
	2. Israel, Belgium, Canada - 17%

**Lowest** percentage who say it **hasn’t had much impact**:
	1. Hungary and Japan - 9%
	2. Greece and Netherlands - 10%


The youngest group (18~29) are most likely to say social media informs about current events compared to the oldest (50+). While the oldest are more likely to say it hasn't had much impact. An example is the US, where 71% of the youngest group say it has made people more informed, with 60% of the oldest who agree. When it comes to not having much impact, 11% of the youngest agree, with 19% of the oldest who say the same.

##### Mixed views regarding increased tolerance by social media, but many agree

![[Impact on Tolerance.png]]

A more **mixed** view happens on **whether social media has made people more accepting of differing backgrounds** (religion, races, ethnic groups). A **median of 45% say it has**, around half of that amount **(22%) say it has made people less accepting**, and close to three-tenths **(29%) say it hasn't made much impact**.

**Highest** percentage who say it has made people **more** tolerant:
	1. South Korea - 62%
	2. Singapore - 51%
	3. Italy - 50%

**Lowest** percentage who say it has made people **more** tolerant:
	1. France - 25%
	2. Hungary - 27%
	3. Netherlands - 30%

  
**Highest** percentage who say it has made people **less** tolerant: 
	1. Netherlands - 45%
	2. Hungary - 42%
	3. Belgium - 39%

**Lowest** percentage who say it has made people **less** tolerant:
	1. Japan - 7%
	2. UK, South Korea - 14%

  
**Highest** percentage who say it **hasn’t had much impact**:
	1. Sweden - 39%
	2. UK - 37%
	3. Japan, Canada - 36%

**Lowest** percentage who say it **hasn’t had much impact**:
	1. Hungary - 18%
	2. South Korea - 21%
	3. Netherlands - 23%

Belgium, Hungary, Netherlands, and France stand out as the countries who **had more people who disagree (37~45%) than who are impartial or agree**.

In most countries (16 out of 19), the youngest group (18~29) say social media has made people more tolerant compared to the oldest group (50+).
##### Majority see social media as making people less civil in talking about politics

![[Less Civil.png]]

The last possible good outcome is **whether social media has made people more civil in political discussions**. And the outcomes show that a **median of (23%) say it has**, and a majority (72%) either say it has made people **less civil (46%)** or are **impartial (26%)**.

Highest percentage who say it has made people more civil in political discussions:
	1. Singapore - 47%
	2. Malaysia - 38%
	3. Germany - 34%

Lowest percentage who say it has made people more civil in political discussions:
	1. Sweden - 9%
	2. Greece - 11%
	3. US - 14%

  
Highest percentage who say it has made people less civil in political discussions:
	1. US - 69%
	2. Australia - 61%
	3. Netherlands - 60%

Lowest percentage who say it has made people less civil in political discussions:
	1. South Korea - 38%
	2. Germany, and Spain - 40%


Highest percentage who say it hasn’t had much impact:
	1. Sweden - 39%
	2. Greece - 35%
	3. UK - 34%

Lowest percentage who say it hasn’t had much impact:
	1. US, Hungary, and Netherlands - 16%

Singapore is the only country where a majority see social media as making people more civil (47%) than who are impartial (25%) or disagree (27%). 

Most countries have more people who are impartial or disagree, than people who say it has made people more civil. 

And people with **higher education say it has made people less civil compared to those with lower education**.

#### Social Media seen as effective for reaching political goals

Figure 3:
![[Effective at Raising Awareness.png]]


The survey had 4 questions regarding the influence of social media when it comes to effecting political change and its impact on political discourse.

A **median of 77% think that social media has been an effective tool to raise public awareness**, with 19% who think otherwise. This is the highest median out of the 4 questions, so it's fair to say that the countries are mostly in agreement about social media being at least somewhat effective at raising awareness for issues. The countries who most agree with this are the UK (87%) and Singapore (86%). The countries who agree the least are Belgium and France, both at 57%. And those with **higher income, and education tend to agree more than their lower income, and education counterparts**.

South Korea agrees the most that social media is effective for changing people's minds, at 87%; behind that is Malaysia at 78%, who is 9 percentage points behind. France and Israel are the least to agree, at 45 and 46%. Younger people **(18~29) are the most likely to say social media is effective at raising awareness and at changing people's minds compared to older groups**.

Social media use may also play a role in seeing the positive effects of social media. **Those who use social media tend to say it is effective at raising awareness and changing people's minds compared to those who don't.**

When it comes to social media’s efficacy towards getting politicians to pay attention to issues, South Korea is the most to say that it has somewhat or very effective, at 85%, with Singapore close behind, at 83%. France and Hungary are the least to agree, at 46 and 47%.

Lastly, a slightly lower median (61%) say that social media is effective at influencing policy decisions in their own country, the lowest out of all questions. South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore agree the most, at 78, 76, 74%. Israel is the least to agree, at 39%, the second is France, at 47%; 8 percentage points ahead of israel. **A majority in Israel (61%) say it is not somewhat/very effective at influencing policy decisions**, while close to 50% in Belgium, France, and Netherlands agree.

Those with **lower income and education are less likely to provide answers to whether it changes minds, influences policy decisions, or brings awareness to issues**. This means that those with **lower income and education may be underrepresented** in these questions.


Among social media users, those who **post about political issues sometimes or often tend to agree on all 4 questions than those who post rarely or never**.

So in all the countries surveyed, at least **40% of the population of every country have said that social media is at least somewhat effective at accomplishing all these goals**.

Additionally, people who **think they have influence in politics in their country tend to agree that social media is at least somewhat effective at influencing policy decisions and bringing issues to the attention of politicians and the public**.

Moreover, **people who post about political issues tend to say social media is effective for all questions**. The authors state that **one potential factor for why people post about political issues is dissatisfaction with how democracy works in their country**. In France, 33% of those who are dissatisfied post sometimes or often, whereas 16% who are satisfied say the same.



#### Potential negatives

The first possible negative outcome is **whether social media has made people more easy to manipulate with false information**. An overwhelming median of **(84%) say it has**, and a small minority **(15%) say it has made people less easy to manipulate or are impartial**. This 84% is the highest median out of any of the questions asked, so it's fair to say that the 19 advanced countries are in high agreement that people are more susceptible to manipulation by false information. 

**In some countries, those who say people are more susceptible to manipulation also tend to agree that social media has made people more informed.**


##### Majority see Social Media leads to divided opinions

![[Divided Political Opinions.png]]


The question of whether **social media has made people more divided in their political opinion** shows a median of **65% who agree**, and a quarter **(26%) who are say it hasn't had much impact**.

The US, Netherlands, and South Korea are the most inclined to agree, at 79~77% consecutively. Japan, France, and Sweden are the most to say it hasn't had much impact (39~30%). And Malaysia, and Singapore are the most to claim it has done the opposite (32 and 23%).

Younger people tend to agree, compared with older age groups. This is also the case between more-educated people and less.

People who agree tend to also say that social media has made people less civil.




#### US as an outlier

Figure 2:
![[US as an Outlier.png]]

When asked whether social media has been bad for society, countries tend to range closely with one another except for Poland (15%) who agreed the least and the US (64%) agreed the most. This trend continues where the US is the highest who agree with the potential negative effects of social media. 

When asked if social media has made people more divided in their political opinions, the US had the highest agreement, at 79%, and Malaysia had the least, at 43%.

Finally, in the question of whether social media has made people less civil in how they communicate about politics has the US at the highest percentage of agreement, sitting at 69%. Meanwhile Singapore agreed the least, at 27%.

All of this to say that the US is exceptional in these questions in that they have shown a generally-unfavorable view of social media when it comes to its impact on politics.






### Younger people more often see social media as a benefit to democracy


Figure:
![[Young Adults More Positive About Social Media.png]]

In the countries surveyed, 14 out of 19 countries had young adults (18~29) say that social media's impact to politics has been a good thing compared to older people (30~49, and 50+). The exception is Italy where slightly more of older adults (ages 30~49) see social media as a postive thing, at 62%, where younger adults agree at 60%. But the youngest group is consistently ahead of the oldest group, being ahead by at least eight percentage points.

Additionally, the oldest group (ages 50+) are consistently behind their younger peers, being the group least likely to agree that social media has been a good thing for politics. They are at least six percentage points behind the second-oldest group (ages 30~49), with the exception of Belgium, where the gap between the two oldest group is 2 percentage points.




### Seeing social media as effective in politics indirectly leads to more offline participation

In a study by Kwak, N., et al. (2018), they analyzed whether or not *perceiving social media as a useful tool to engage in politics would promote political expression in social media, and therefore increase offline political participation*. The finding was that it **does seem to be the case that perceived usefulness of social media on politics helps political expression in social media, which influences offline political participation**. However, researchers note that it doesn't seem to be the case for those are exposed diverse political views, and for younger people.


## Negative

### Older people tend to share more fake news than younger people.

There is a prevalent narrative at least in the US media about social media having an important role in spreading disinformation, but this actually happened in very rare instances. In a study by Andrew Guess et al. (2019), they conducted a survery which had 3500 respondents, and out of those respondents, 1/3 of the respondents shared their Facebook data. These include public information in their profile, such as their political affiliation, timeline posts, and **liked** pages.  

What they found was that **8.5% (101) of respondents have shared at least 1 fake news story**. The ones who shared a fake news story tend to be more conservative. In those 8.5% figure, 38 were Republicans as opposed to 17 Democrats, which amounts to 18.1% of Republicans and 3.5% of Democrats.

The reason brought up for why this could be is that most fake news article tend to be pro-Trump, and that people would probably share articles they agree with. So the authors thought it might not be a tendency of just being conservative that will compel you to share fake news but more so that they just agree with pro-Trump narratives at the time. So it's entirely possible that conservatives aren't more prone to spreading minsinformation, they just agree with pro-Trump articles, that just so happen to be fake news.

**Another finding was that the older you get, the more likely you are to share fake news stories**. This happened consistently, regardless of education, political leaning, and posting activity. **Anyone over the age of 65 were 7 times more likely to share a fake news story compared to the youngest group (18~29)**, and 2 times more likely than the second-oldest group (45~65). And respondents in each category were more likely to share fake news than the next-younger group. **So the trend is that the older you get, the more likely you are to share a fake news article.**

The authors' explanation for this is that older people may not be digitally literate to discern fake news from real news. And the general effect of aging in memory, in that the older you get, the less likely you are to resist persistent beliefs and fake narratives dressed to be real.

#### Counter arguments 

There are some counters for why sharing fake news is rare, and they are addressed in the paper. 

- "They don't share links, anyway"
	![[Distribution of Total and Fake news Share.jpeg]]
	In the figure on the left, majority of the respondents shared less than 500 web links overall. And the figure on the right, most respondents shared 0 fake news articles.
	Out of the 1191 respondents, 90.8% shared at least 1 link during data collection. In that 90.8% figure (1080), a minority (3.5%) shared 10 or fewer links, and the majority (61.3%) shared in the ranges of: 100~1000 links. So the sharing of fake news is still an expectional occurrence.


- "They share anything, anyway" 
	![[Mean Fake News Shared vs Demograpics.jpeg]]
	In Figure D, those who shared the most articles (at least 2001) tend to share less fake news articles. So the claim of "people will share anything" is not true, otherwise the more articles you've shared, the more likely you are to have shared a fake news article.

What this instead shows is that people who share a lot of links are more able to distinguish between fake news and real news. 


### Most agree social media makes people susceptible to manipulation

![[Social Media Makes Population Susceptible to Manipulation.png]]

In 17 countries, at least 70% of the population say that social media has made people easier to manipulate. The US ranks 6th-highest to agree, with 85%. Netherlands, Australia, the UK, Spain and Belgium are the highest, ranging from 87 (Belgium and Spain) to 92% (Netherlands) who agree. 

The authors also note that younger people and those who have attained higher education are more likely to say the same.

Malaysia and Poland are the least to agree, with 51% and 60%, respectively. Additionally, Malaysia is the only country who has a substantial population (29%) who say social media has made people **less** easy to manipulate. The country closest to say the same is Singapore, at 16%.





### [Americans Who Mainly Get Their News on Social Media Are Less Engaged, Less Knowledgeable](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/07/30/americans-who-mainly-get-their-news-on-social-media-are-less-engaged-less-knowledgeable/)

Not read, yet.



## Other arguments

### "Does social media affect elections?"

In a study by Harris and Harrigan (2015), they analyzed the role of social media during the 2010 UK election campaign. They found was that the general election was far from being largely influenced by social media. 

They concluded that social media can create an impact in the local level as long as it's implemented as a long-term relationship-building strategy, and it may not be suited for short-term effects like influencing the result of a political campaign. 

So the paper asserts that the impact of social media varies depending on how it's implemented.


### Older generations do not engage in social media to talk about political issues

A study by Kruse, L. and Norris, D. (2017) interviewed Millenials and Gen X-ers to test this claim. Their research suggests that respondents do not engage in social media like a public sphere. The authors attributed this to 3 factors: (1) fear of online harassments and potential workplace repercussions. (2) enganging in political discourse with politically-aligned others, leaving no room for disagreements. (3) Characterizing social media as a place for light-hearted engagements.

A public sphere is a space for people to come together and talk about societal issues. An ideal public sphere is where differing opinions can come to an agreement and reach a public opinion.



### Negative effects of social media index

Figure X:
![[Negative Effect of Social Media Index.png]]

In the four-possible-good-two-possible-bad-outcomes survey, respondents who answered negatively in the six questions were coded as 1 in the index, meaning they agree that social media has made people **less**: (1~2) informed domestically/internationally; (3) accepting of differing backgrounds; (4) civil in how they talk about politics. And those who agree that social media has made people **more**: (1) easy to manipulate; (2) divided in their opinions, were coded the same. An opposing or indefferent answer are coded as 0. And respondents who answered "don't know" to any of the six questions were excluded from the index.

The outcome is that the US is the highest among countries who had negative views on the possible outcomes of social media, with Netherlands trailing close. The **average** response in the US gave a negative view of at least three of the six questions asked (3.05). While Netherlands gave close-to-three (2.90) negative opinions. 

Surprisingly, Hungary has the third-highest index (2.80) despite being the third who **least** view social media as a bad thing for democracy.

And the least likely to give negative opinions on the effects of social media in politics is Singapore (1.97), followed by Poland (2.05). These two countries are also the two least to view social media as a bad thing for politics.

This shows that in all the countries surveyed, an average of 2 questions was answered in a negative
